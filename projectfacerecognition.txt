# project Face Recognition
==========================
1. collect data of various person
    - Asking multiple people to come in front of webcam, click 20 each pictures each
    - Store the part of the image containing the face(Haarcascade to detect the face)
2. Train a classifier to learn who is the person(classification).
    - Load the training data(.npy arrays)
    - Store the data and target values(Labels)

3. predicting the name of the person using the model.
    - Read the video stream
    - Extract the face out of it
    - Predict the label for that face
        - Logistic reg(parametric algorithm)
        - neural natwork
        - KNN (non-parametric : look for similarity in nearest neighbour)
